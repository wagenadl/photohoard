Alternatives to Photohoard
==========================

Of course, there are several alternatives to Photohoard. Just to
mention a few that work with Linux:

  Shotwell

    is a default application for organizing photos
    in Ubuntu and GNOME. At last check, its editing tools were limited.

  Digikam

    has excellent organization facilities. It also
    has strong editing capabilities, but they are not nondestructive in the
    usual sense: Edited versions must be saved to a new file.

  Darktable

    has the best editing capabilities, far more advanced than
    Photohoard. It is less suitable for maintaining large collections,
    because its thumbnailing system does not cache arbitrarily large
    numbers of files.

  RawTherapee

    is even more focused on developing images than Darktable, and less
    focused on organizing collections. Really great for getting the
    most out of your camera's raw files.

  Google Photos

    offers organization and many of the same editing tools as
    Photohoard, but keeps your photos in the corporate cloud.
