Browsing: Using the date strip
------------------------------

In default mode, Photohoard displays a “date strip” of photos on the left,
one “current” photo in the center, and a series of adjustment
sliders on the right. The date strip is organized into “epochs” of
various lengths. An epoch can be: a decade, a year, a month, a day, an
hour, or ten minutes. To open an epoch, simply click on the tile  that
represents that epoch. If an epoch contains more than a few photos,
sub-epochs contained in it stay collapsed until you click on their
tiles. To uncollapse an epoch all at once, hold Shift while
clicking. To recollapse an epoch, simply click on the tab by the
epoch. (Try it; it is easier to navigate than it sounds.)

Viewing a subset of photos
--------------------------

Collapsing part of the date strip is one way to view only a subset
of photos, but it may be helpful to show only photos that share a
certain tag, where taken with a particular camera, or have a color label
attached. These criteria (and several more) can all be used to limit which
images are shown in the date strip. To do so, open the Filter dialog
by clicking the Filter icon or pressing Control+F. Several criteria
may be applied at once.
