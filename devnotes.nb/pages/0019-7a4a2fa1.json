Even if I delete it by hand from the database, it would be scanned right back in the next time around. So there should be a place to maintain roots and set exclusions. I don’t know quite how to do this. I could possibly add an “exclude subtree” list to the “add root” dialog. Or I could have a separate option to do it post-hoc. Of course, post-hoc exclusion would mean dropping versions. There should be a warning if that involves modified versions or versions with non-default tags.",
