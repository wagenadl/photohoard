But it may be better to partially undo. E.g., if in one step I changed “cropleft” from 0 to 50 and in another from 50 to 120, then undoing that first step should perhaps leave the “cropleft” at 70. That is, perhaps it is best to store relative changes in the undo table, at least for adjustments. (And perhaps rot90.) Of course, for colorlabel etc., I’d still like to use absolute changes, so the “oldvalue” and “newvalue” columns are important. Perhaps I should just calculate the relative change at undo time from those columns. And for ordinary popping undo, I could use the absolute “oldvalue” to prevent rounding errors.",
